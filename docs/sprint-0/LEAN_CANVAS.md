3. **Local Market Knowledge** - Deep GDL/Tulum networks

**Riskiest Assumption**:  
"Personality matching meaningfully improves social connection outcomes vs random grouping"

**How to Test**:
- A/B test: Personality-matched vs interest-only matched
- Measure: Post-event NPS, friend connections made, return rate

**Go/No-Go Decision (Month 3)**:
- ✅ GO if: 500+ users, NPS >60, 70% repeat rate
- ❌ NO-GO if: <200 users, NPS <40, <40% repeat rate
